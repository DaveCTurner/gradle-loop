gradle-loop - Run `./gradlew ${args}` repeatedly, to help with potentially-flaky tests.

Example invocation:

    gradle-loop :server:test --tests 'org.elasticsearch.example.ExampleTests.testFlaky'

By default, keeps re-running Gradle until the first failure.

The output from the failure is captured in the files
test-output-stdout.txt and test-output-stderr.txt

## Git branch tracking

If the environment variable ${BRANCH} is set, before each run it will
hard-reset the current branch to `origin/${BRANCH}`:

    git reset --hard --recurse-submodules origin/${BRANCH}

This allows you to modify the commit on which we are looping: update
`origin/${BRANCH}` in the background e.g. with `git fetch origin` and
the new commit will get picked up on the next iteration. For example:

    export BRANCH=2026/01/10/example-test-branch
    git checkout ${BRANCH}

## Stress-testing

If the environment variable ${GRADLE_LOOP_STRESSOR} is set, its value is
executed as a shell command in parallel with each iteration. For example:

    export GRADLE_LOOP_STRESSOR='stress-ng --cpu 16'

This is often a good way to expose flakiness due to rare race conditions,
because if the CPUs are otherwise stressed then tasks will be scheduled
in more unusual orders.

If the underlying Git commit changes between runs, the first iteration with
the new commit does not run with the stressor. This makes it faster to
complete all the one-time activities that happen on a fresh commit, such
as compilation.

## Preclean

If the environment variable ${GRADLE_LOOP_PRECLEAN} is set, its value is
executed as a shell command before each iteration. For example:

    export GRADLE_LOOP_PRECLEAN='rm -rvf modules/project/build/testrun/javaRestTest/temp'

## Bisection

If the file `gradle-loop-bisect-candidates.txt` is present, its contents
are expected to be a list of Git commits, formatted as `git log --pretty=oneline`,
which need to be searched by bisection. TODO more details here.

bisectCandidatesFile = "gradle-loop-bisect-candidates.txt"

bisectHistoryFile = "gradle-loop-bisect-history.json"
